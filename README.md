- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tonande02, a bit new to GitHub, pleased to meet ya! =)
- About me:
- ðŸ‘€ My language is Python, and at the moment I'm having a lot of fun building side projects and taking some online courses to improve my skills, on top of completing a BA in informatics.
- ðŸŒ± I'm really interested in AI/ML, and on the side I enjoy tinkering with games development.
- I look forward to finding fun projects to collaborate on, and to learn from all the exciting things the community gets up to!
